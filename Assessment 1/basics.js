//Q1. Create a file with name basics and show all the features that you know about javascript? (minimum 5 and maximum 8 topics)
// Try explaining in 1-2 lines : example - Prototype : An object which behaves as a link between two functions and provides inheritance

//1. Bind
//A function expression that binds the context of an object with an event handler function such as click, hover, and can be used with setTimeout

//2. Call and Apply
//Extended functions that allow a function to use an object passed as a parameter as context/scope for the function. Call accepts an object as the first parameter
//  and then subsequent parameters for the function afterwars. Apply accepts an object as the first parameter, then an array of data representing the following parameters

//3. Closure
//When a functions return another function with properties that we want to expose. The outer function acts similarly to a class and returns the inner function.

//4. Callback
//A function that is used as a parameter in another function and called within. Useful for reusing functions in different contexts.

//5. Over-writing
//The last function definition replaces all previous function definitions and gets hoisted to the top

//6. Hoisting
//Hoisting is where functions and variables are pulled to the top so information about them is known. It is why JS is often considered partially compiled.
